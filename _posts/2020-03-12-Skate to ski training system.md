The program is designed as a progression of Phases. In Phase 1, you’ll cover basic skills
that ensure you’re ready to progress. Phases 2-4 get into true cross-training for skiing.
Many of these drills are derived from proven methods of ski training drills used by the
PSIA and the U.S. Ski Team.

We hope you’ll find this program as fun to try out as it was for us to build. And if you’re
able to progress through the entire program, you will absolutely be in the best skiready
shape possible for next winter.

“The Rollerblade® Skate to Ski program is the most ski
specific off-snow program you can do as a skier. Not only
does it train ski specific movements and patterns that will
translate into better skiing when you return to snow, but
it will increase agility, strength, mobility, and work your
cardiovascular system as well. Plus it’s FUN!”

**KATIE RYAN - US SKI TEAM**

“The adrenaline rush and freedom I get from skiing in the
winter I now get from inline skating during the warmer
months. Skating allows me to be outside with my friends
and get a great cardio workout.”

**BRENNAN RUBIE - US SKI TEAM**

“Whether I’m ripping around the neighborhood, or
preparing for the next ski season, inline skating is a
versatile way to have some fun, and switch it up.”

## Before you roll

**New to skating?**

Inline skating is a great all around workout. It hits every aspect
of fitness. But it also requires some unique knowledge to get
the most out of the experience – including safety.

**Choosing the right skates** is a critical part of getting
the most out of this program.

For this program, we recommend choosing one of our molded shell skates over a soft
upper skate. Both will get the job done, but as you progress through the program,
the carving control you get from a molded skate will make the exercises easier to
perform, and more accurately recreate the sensation of skiing on pavement.

**Wear protective gear**. A helmet is essential, and the
three basic pieces of gear – wrist guards, kneepads, and
elbow pads are highly recommended. You will likely be
pushing yourself in these exercises. Wear the gear.

You may notice Brennan and Katie skating in the videos wear only a helmet. They are
highly accomplished skaters and skiers and chose to skate with minimal protection.
Unless you’ve also been a World Cup downhill ski racer on the U.S. Ski Team, we HIGHLY
recommend putting on all the gear. And those of you who are World Cup racers – you
really should wear all the gear too.

**Where are the poles?** You’ll notice that none in the
program show skating with poles. The reason for this is simple – focus.
Poles can create an unnecessary distraction while skating and can
even be dangerous in certain situations.

You’re free to try these exercises with poles if you wish. Just make sure they aren’t
distracting you from the task at hand. And most importantly, make sure they don’t cause
a risk to you or anyone around you.

### Choosing terrain

Just like in skiing, it’s important to skate on terrain that’s within your ability to navigate
safely. Unlike in skiing, there are no trail markers to let you know what lies ahead.
Before you head out to skate, make sure you know the road ahead and the variables
that are likely to exist. Here are some of the major things to consider.

**Slope**

This is the one that you will most need to recalibrate if you’re
used to skiing down hills. Even the slightest pitch in a paved
trail or road will cause you to pick up speed very quickly.
Make sure you are super strong at braking and controlling
your speed before you venture onto any sloped surface.

**Quality of pavement**

Again, just like in skiing, the condition of the surface you
will be skating makes a huge difference in your ability to
control yourself. Avoid water, sand, and deep cracks in the
pavement.

**Traffic**

The paved surface you’ll be skating on may have
pedestrians, bikes, or even motor vehicles. Make sure you
are obeying any local rules about skating in a location, and
be super aware of your surroundings.

As you progress through the various phases of the Skate to Ski Training System, you
will also progress to more challenging terrain. Here is a guide to how we classify the
increasing challenge of inline skate terrain. In all cases it is assumed the pavement is dry,
free of sand or debris, and is free of cracks that can grab your wheels.

**Beginner Terrain**: Absolutely flat surface such as a tennis court, basketball
court, or flat and smooth parking lot free of active traffic.

**Intermediate Terrain**: A smooth paved path wide enough to make turns.
A smooth paved road relatively free of pedestrians or other traffic. Will have
slight slope and pitch that will cause you to pick up moderate amounts of
speed.

**Advanced Terrain**: A smooth paved trail or road that will have a moderate
slope, not steep, that will cause you to rapidly pick up speed. At no point is
a steep slope recommended or necessary to use the Skate to Ski Training
System.

### Pre-skate checklist

Always inspect your skating equipment before each use. You wouldn’t head out on the
slopes without properly functioning bindings, skis, or boots. Same should be true for
your skates. Perform the following quick checks before you head out.

* Wiggle each wheel to check axle tightness.
* Check the screws/bolts that secure the wheels to make sure they are tight. If bolts
that secure the wheels are loose, tighten them with the Allen wrench included in
the box. This is especially important with recently changed or rotated wheels.
* Spin wheels to check that bearings are spinning freely.
* Examine the wheels for wear. Excessively worn wheels decrease overall
performance and control.
* Inspect brake pads for wear and tightness. Inspect all other brake components to
ensure that they are secure and in working order.
* Check for worn laces and loose buckles. Replace or have repaired if needed.
* Beware of loose laces while skating.
* Check for frame damage (e.g. cracks, breaks, bends) and that they are securely
mounted.
* Look for cracks in the shell and cuff. If cracks are detected, do not use your skates
and have them replaced or repaired.
* Wear one pair of athletic socks. Skates should fit securely without
being too tight or uncomfortable.
* For optimal ankle support, make sure your ankle area is laced or buckled tightly
when first starting out.
* Wear ALL the protective gear - helmet, wrist guards, elbow and knee pads.

## Phase 1

Once you’ve
got the basics of movement and stopping down, you’re ready for Phase 1. In Phase 1 the focus is on creating a solid foundation for the work ahead.

### A-Frame turn

{% include video id="gSBdlaPjcT0" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![A-Frame](/assets/images/skate-a-frame.jpg){: .align-right}-->
Begin on a smooth, flat, paved surface with no slope.

**Objective**

This drill is a great way to develop a balanced stance and learn direction change at
slow to medium speeds. This is the equivalent of the wedge turn on skis. The goal is
to learn to link turns using the A-frame stance.

**If done correctly**

* Knees and ankles are flexed throughout
* Upper body calm and upright, hips over heels, knees over toes
* Feet are wider than hip width apart, with 70% pressure applied to outside
leg,
30% on the inside leg
* Turns are on inside edges, round, smooth, and linked together

**Common challenges**

* Feet come together, A-frame stance is lost
* Leaning into the turn, putting more pressure on inside leg
* One foot gets ahead of the other
* Upper body rotation towards the turn

**Summary**

Maintain a flexed ready stance throughout the turn. Keep both feet at the same width,
and do not let one leg advance in front of the other. If you are having trouble, direct
more pressure to the outside skate. This will allow the inside leg to rotate through the
turn more easily.

Once you have the A-Frame turn mastered in both directions, using a little more
momentum, practice linking several turns in a row or down a very slight slope.
Experiment with a wider or a narrower stance to see how this affects turn shape.

### Braking on a hill

{% include video id="0N5HYDZ2W2U" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Braking](/assets/images/skate-braking.jpg){: .align-right}-->
Choose a very slight slope to test and improve your ability to use the brake
effectively. Braking down a hill requires significantly more skill than braking
on a level surface.

**Objective**

To learn speed control and stopping while going down a slope. To develop the braking
skill and confidence needed to safely navigate slight to moderately sloped surfaces.

**If done correctly**

* Knees and ankles are deeply flexed, hands out front
* The braking foot is scissored fully out in front of the back balancing foot
* The stance should be as narrow as possible – less than hip width
* Pressure is applied gradually to the braking foot until almost 100% of pressure is
applied directly to the brake pad

**Common challenges**

* Braking foot not scissored forward far enough
* Turning as brake is applied = Stance is too wide
* Upper body bending forward at waist
* Legs straight and locked instead of flexed

**Summary**

After you’re comfortable stopping on the flats at different speeds, its time to start
experimenting with different slopes to see how your newfound braking skills hold up.
Try slowing yourself with your brake pad but not stopping. Speed control is an essential
part of skating no matter what terrain your skating.
Respect gravity. Take on increasingly steeper slopes only when you are 100% confident
in your ability to slow and stop yourself. The faster you are moving, and the steeper the
slope, the longer distance you will need to stop.

### Striding for power

{% include video id="2Rut-H6m0jE" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Striding](/assets/images/skate-striding.jpg){: .align-right}-->
Begin on a smooth, flat, paved surface with no slope. Ideally you should pick
a route where you are able to skate in one direction for at least 5-10 minutes.

**Objective**

To learn a more powerful, efficient stride. Develop a deeper, longer stride that begins
from the outside edge and finishes on the inside edge of the wheels. The motion
should be very similar to skate skiing.

**If done correctly**

* The striding foot is placed down directly on, or slightly past, a center line under
your hips
* The striding foot is placed down pointing directly forward
* The stride starts on the outside edge of the wheels requiring 100% momentary
balance on the foot about to stride
* There is a gliding moment on one leg before pushing off again on the next stride
* Knee of the gliding leg is flexed and over the toe

**Common challenges**

* Constant striding with no gliding in between strides
* Short choppy strides only using inside edges of wheels
* Stride foot placed down at an angle like a duck
* Knees and ankles not flexed enough

**Summary**

Start the stride with your pinky toe (outside edge). Push and roll your foot all the way
through your heel (inside edge) to get as much power out of your stride as possible. As
the power from your stride increases, you can spend more time gliding between pushes
for more efficient skating. Try using a cadence count of 1, 2, 3 throughout each stride to
ensure you are truly gliding between strides.

Remember that loose fitting skates are like poor fitting ski boots – and will make this
skill difficult to perform. Check to ensure that all laces are tied and buckles are snug to
allow for better power transfer and balance.

### Parallel turns

{% include video id="BGKamSmx9XQ" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Parallel turns](/assets/images/skate-parallel-turns.jpg){: .align-right}-->
Begin on a smooth, flat, paved surface. A very slight slope may be helpful
to fully develop this skill. Without any pitch it can be harder to create and
maintain momentum throughout linked parallel turns.

**Objective**

This is like progressing from wedge turns on skis to parallel turns. It is the breakthrough
skill that will allow you to truly cross-train for skiing on skates. If you’re
already familiar with parallel turns on skis, you have two legs up in learning this skill
over the average inline skater.

**If done correctrly**

* Skater maintains a flexed stance throughout the turn
* The left leg scissors ahead for a left turn, right leg scissors ahead for a right turn
* Skater maintains a relatively narrow stance – less than hip width. The flatter the
terrain, the narrower the stance needs to be
* Skates are rolled on edge with the outside leg using the inside edge, and the
inside leg using the outside edge

**Common challenges**

* Too wide a stance – unable to roll skates on edge
* Being too upright with locked legs
* Going too slowly on a flat surface – some momentum is necessary

**Summary**

The parallel turn is the fundamental skill needed to progress further in this program. In
order to create linked parallel skate turns, it will take practice. Eventually you will want
to progress to a slight slope that you feel comfortable with. The perfect location has a
continuous slight slope that allows you to maintain momentum as you link one turn to
the next.

### Free skate

{% include video id="C4z4Bav-zMI" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

Find your favorite local spot that has a combination of perfectly flat areas and
areas with slight slope to experiment with your new found skills. It’s time to
have some fun.

**Objective**

Learn to be a solid all-around inline skater. Apply all the skills learned so far to
explore your local terrain. Develop solid coordination & balance, build endurance,
and gain the confidence needed to progress in this program.

**If done correctly**

* Skater is able to identify terrain that is within their ability to skate
* Skater has fully learned the skills in Phase 1 and is using them regularly as they skate
* Skater is confident and having fun

**Common challenges**

* Remembering to check out the terrain ahead before skating
* Skating down hills or in areas that are beyond the skater’s ability
* Jumping ahead to Phase 2 before mastering Phase 1

**Summary**

Find a route that you can comfortably skate in roughly 30 minutes. On flat sections
and inclines, work on maintaining a constant rhythm and velocity with your stride. On
downhill sections, work on your parallel turns and braking. Think about how turning on
skates is similar to skiing and how it’s different. See if you can improve your time along
your route while maintaining good technique and control.
Continue with your free skating until parallel turns, long smooth strides, and controlled
speed on slight to moderate hills becomes routine. When you reach this milestone, you
are ready to move on to Phase 2 and beyond.

### Phase 1 checklist

Before progressing to phase 2, make sure you
are solid on the following:

* Using your brake for speed control
* Stopping on flat and sloped terrain
* Easily changing direction at will
* Gliding between strides for at least a 2-3 second cadence
* Performing smooth parallel turns in both directions
* Performing parallel turns in short to long radius turns
* Knowing how to identify appropriate terrain within your ability
* Being able to free skate for 30 minutes at a moderate pace

## Phase 2

In Phase 2 the focus shifts from skating on flat surfaces into using slightly
sloped terrain. In this phase, you’ll begin to apply your foundation skills into
more ski-specific movements.

### Balance & agility

{% include video id="nTGEIFoB0Rk" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Balance](/assets/images/skate-balance.jpg){: .align-right}-->
Begin on a smooth, flat, non-rolling surface such as grass or carpet. Progress
to a smooth, flat, paved surface with no slope.

**Objective**

To develop a solid sense of balance and coordination on your skates.

**If done correctly**

* Skater is able to maintain tempo of lateral hops and hold steady on one foot
between jumps
* A proper ready stance is maintained with ankles and knees flexed
* Skater is able to balance and roll short distances on each foot equally and
independently
* Upper body becomes more relaxed and calm throughout the skating motion
* Leg movements become smooth and controlled while skating

**Common challenges**

* Balance cannot be maintained on one foot
* Standing too tall without proper ankle and knee flexion
* Frequent excessive upper body movement to recover balance
* Skater is too rigid and lacking fluidity during the skating motion

**Summary**

Inline skates have a much shorter platform on which to balance than skis. Developing a
stable platform is essential to progressing with your skating. The video offers some basic
balance exercises. Try out some other motions to truly challenge and hone your sense of
balance and coordination on skates:

* A rolling lunge with the front leg in a deep bend and the back leg tracking behind
on only the toe wheel
* Gliding straight balancing on only one foot for as long as possible
* Pumping both legs from narrow to out wide to narrow again repeatedly as you
glide forward (sometimes called swizzles)

### Angulation turns

{% include video id="7plZgET8Ktw" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Angulation turns](/assets/images/skate-angulation-turns.jpg){: .align-right}-->
Find a low to moderate pitch that allows you to maintain momentum while
making consistent, medium radius turns.

**Objective**

To evolve the basic parallel turn into a more dynamic and energized turn. To use the
turn to manage speed and direction on sloped terrain.

**If done correctly**

* Skater can link turns with various turns shapes
* Shoulders are level with upper body oriented down the slope
* Turns are more dynamic with deeper flexion and increased angulation
* Skater begins to experiment with speed control on a slope through turn shape

**Common challenges**

* Choosing a slope that’s too steep causing loss of control
* Leaning into the slope with too much weight on the inside leg
* Too much motion or rotation in the upper body
* Inside foot scissored too far ahead of outside foot – making a hockey turn vs a ski turn

**Summary**

Your skate turns should now feel very similar to your ski turns. Deep flexion, dynamic
energy, and direction control on a slope define successful angulation turns. Experiment
with how deep a carve you can make with hips dropped into the turn and legs outside
your body.

As mentioned previously - respect gravity. Take on increasingly steeper slopes only
when you are 100% confident in your ability to slow and stop yourself. Finding the right
slope is essential for this drill. Too little will prevent momentum needed for continuous
turns and deeper angulation. Too much slope will make this too difficult and potentially
cause a loss of control.

### Line jumps

{% include video id="SnUvDqu2QUc" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Line jumps](/assets/images/skate-line-jumps.jpg){: .align-right}-->
Ideally a flat, empty parking lot with parking space lines. If no painted lines
are available, you can place cones an even distance apart.

**Objective**

To jump consecutive lines while maintaining balance during take off and landing.
Progressing your balance and agility to include small jumps while rolling.

**If done correctly**

* Skater should lift both feet off the ground simultaneously
* Skater should maintain balance lifting off the ground and on landing
* Feet remain hip width apart and are parallel at all times

**Common challenges**

* Skater is landing loudly
* Skater is using the upper body in excess to lift feet off ground – jumping with the
upper body as opposed to the lower body
* Skater is not maintaining a straight line
* Skater is not landing on both feet simultaneously

**Summary**

Skating like skiing will require you to avoid obstacles. A deep crack, sewer grate,
sidewalk curb, or unsavory road kill may be in your future. Learning to jump and land
while maintaining balance in motion is an important skill in your quiver. Once you have
mastered line jumps on flat terrain, try doing them on a slight to moderate slope.

### T-stopping

{% include video id="GHidXyjqoCA" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![T-stopping](/assets/images/skate-t-stopping.jpg){: .align-right}-->
Begin on a smooth, flat, paved surface. As you become stronger with the
T-Stop, progress to slightly sloped surfaces.

**Objective**

To learn an alternate method of speed control and slowing to a stop on inline skates.

**If done correctly**

* Motion begins with 100% of weight on the front foot
* Ankles & knees are deeply flexed with front knee over the front toe
* Skater drags back foot with even weight and pressure progressively applied to all
wheels evenly
* Dragging foot is perpendicular to front foot
* Rolling front foot should be perpendicular to the ground or even balanced slightly
on the outside edge of the wheels
* Heel of the dragging foot is 12”-18” directly behind the heel of the rolling foot

**Common challenges**

* Skater spins around due to too much weight too quickly on the dragging foot
* Skater spins around due to dragging foot being out to the side rather than directly
behind
* Skater spins around due to front rolling foot leaning on inside edge of wheels
* Skater drags only the toe wheel rather than all wheels evenly

**Summary**

T-Stopping is a great skill to add to your quiver. For those who prefer to skate without
a brake, T-Stopping is essential. Remember though that slowing and stopping with a
brake is more effective than T-Stopping.

If you are struggling with T-stopping, try a rolling lunge with almost 100% of weight on
front rolling foot. Maintain just enough pressure on the back rolling toe wheel to prevent
it from wobbling. When you are comfortable maintaining this rolling position, the
next move is to pivot the back foot over to become the dragging foot. Remember there
should be almost no weight on the dragging foot initially. Once all wheels are dragging,
progressively add pressure to the dragging foot while tracking straight forward.

### Skating uphill

{% include video id="sZ7M2FnDcCY" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Skating uphill](/assets/images/skate-uphill.jpg){: .align-right}-->
The most ideal location for learning this skill is a loop with a short, steep
incline going up, that leads to a more gradual slope going down to practice
other skills.

**Objective**

Develop solid technique for getting to the top of inclined terrain. Use uphill skating
to improve your cardio, power, and endurance.

**If done correctly**

* Skater will only skate up terrain they are able to safely skate down
* Skater should use a wider more open stride to maintain momentum and pace
uphill, especially on steeper hills
* Shoulders face forward while arms swing to generate power
* Proper form is maintain as described in “Striding for Power” in Phase 1

**Common challenges**

* Strides are too short and choppy
* Upper body twists into the stride
* Skater loses momentum

**Summary**

Many of the skill in this program require skating down a slope. Getting to the top of
a hill on inline skates takes effort. It’s an amazingly effective way to develop aerobic
and anaerobic fitness. With inline skating you truly have to earn your turns.
As you progress through the program, a great terrain choice is a loop where you can
gain most of your elevation up a steeper incline that leads to a more gradual decent
back to your start point. This is perfect for interval training – intense up, gradual down.

### Phase 2 checklist

Before progressing to phase 3, make sure you
are solid on the following:

* Balancing in motion on each leg individually
* Turning with deep knee and ankle flexion and angulation
* Making smooth and consistent short and long radius turns
* Safely navigating slight to moderately sloped terrain
* Jumping vertically while rolling
* Effectively T-Stopping for speed control
* Maintaining momentum and good form while uphill skating

## Phase 3

In Phase 3 the focus shifts into true ski specific cross-training exercises.
For anyone who has trained for ski racing, many of these drills should
look familiar.

### Uphill hand down the hill

{% include video id="rI2f15ZOvbQ" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Uphill hand](/assets/images/skate-hand.jpg){: .align-right}-->
A wide road free of traffic or other paved surface with a mild to moderate
slope. Make sure you have enough space to travel across the fall line for a few
seconds.

**Objective**

Establish solid body mechanics between upper and lower body. Develop proper
weight and edge transition in a turn.

**If done correctly**

* The uphill hand is pointed down the fall line towards the transition of the next turn
* Upper body remains facing down the hill throughout the turns
* Smooth switch of hands with body following the hand into the top of the new turn

**Common challenges**

* Upper body over-rotates into the turn and doesn’t remain facing down the hill
* Confusion on which hand points forward - remember the name of the exercise
* Skater only uses arms stiffly without having core of body follow hand into new
turn
* Skater bent over at the waist

**Summary**

A common challenge in ski and skate turns down a hill is rotating too much at the
bottom of the turn. By switching hands into the new turn, this naturally stacks your body
in an efficient way and keeps pressure on your outside skate through the turn.
Once you have mastered this exercise, you will be more effective in transitioning from
one turn to the next down a hill.

### Hourglass turns

{% include video id="1MkGPjrmWF4" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Uphill hand](/assets/images/skate-hourglass.jpg){: .align-right}-->
A wide road free of traffic or other paved surface with a mild to moderate
slope. Make sure you have enough space to set the cones or markers
according to the instructions in the video. Also ensure that cone placement
does not create a hazard for anyone.

**Objective**

To develop speed control through different turn shapes. To be able to vary turn shape
as conditions demand.

**If done correctly**

* Turns are performed smoothly while matching the hourglass shape of the course
* Proper Angulation Turn form is maintained as turn shapes vary
* Skater uses the full width of the course at the widest points

**Common challenges**

* Skater loses control of speed
* Turns are not symmetrical
* Balance is disrupted by changes in rhythm
* Skater passes beyond the lane established by the cones

**Summary**

This is the first of two exercises that force you to look and think ahead as you skate
down a hill. It also requires you to fully utilize the Angulation Turn skills honed
in Phase 2. By lapping this course, you can also get in some high intensity uphill
skating between runs.
For added challenge, add two more pairs of cones at the bottom of the course that
become medium and then narrow at the finish. This will further challenge your ability
to control your speed through turn shape.

### Lane changes

{% include video id="CAj1W2TCB6o" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Lane changes](/assets/images/skate-lane-changes.jpg){: .align-right}-->
A wide road free of traffic or other paved surface with a mild to moderate
slope. Make sure you have enough space to set the cones or markers
according to the instructions in the video. Also ensure that cone placement
does not create a hazard for anyone.

**Objective**

Similar to Hourglass Turns, this drill is also intended to develop speed control
through different turn shapes. To be able to vary turn shape as conditions demand.

**If done correctly**

* Turns are performed smoothly while matching the rhythm of 3 Short Turns followed
by a Long Traverse
* Proper Angulation Turn form is maintained as turn shapes vary
* Traverse is perpendicular to the fall line
* Skater uses the full width of the course while traversing
* Short turns are performed in the outer lanes while maintaining consistent velocity

**Common challenges**

* Skater traverses down the slope gaining too much speed
* Short radius turns are not consistent in shape and velocity
* Skater doesn’t complete the 3 turns & traverse before the next cone

**Summary**

This is the second of two exercises that focus on using turn shape to control speed
and direction. At this point you should be feeling the physical and mental similarities
between skating down a hill and skiing down a hill.
Whether you’re a world-class ski racer, or enjoy skiing on a recreational level, being
able to change the rhythm of your turns is an incredibly important skill. This drill
forces you to constantly change where on the hill you are performing your turns,
improving agility and control.

### Traversing

{% include video id="aNrIHje1DNw" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Traversing](/assets/images/skate-traversing.jpg){: .align-right}-->
A wide road free of traffic or other paved surface with a mild to moderate
slope. Make sure you have enough space to perform a long traverse. You can
use your brake or t-stopping skills at the end of each traverse to slow down, or
simply make a small turn up the hill to slow your momentum.

**Objective**

Develop strong hip position, coordination, and balance when transitioning from one
turn into the next. The traverse drill lengthens the time between turns to allow for
more focus on correct body position.

**If done correctly**

* Traverses are perpendicular to the fall line to create the time needed to perform the
movements
* Hips are stacked over the knees and ankles
* Upper body is balanced and quiet with focus on lower body and feet

**Common challenges**

* Traversing across the slope at an angle that creates to much acceleration
* Skater loses balance performing the required footwork
* Foot movement is erratic and heavy-footed instead of controlled and smooth

**Summary**

These drills test your ability to move to the new downhill skate and balance on it
before starting the next turn. It is designed to sniff out weakness in form and allow
for time in the traverse to correct bad habits.

For added challenge, perform this exercise on a slope that is at the steeper end of
your comfort zone. Though as always, make sure it isn’t too steep for you to safely
navigate.

### Stomp turns

{% include video id="KUFU6bgUyWk" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Stomp turns](/assets/images/skate-stomp-turns.jpg){: .align-right}-->
A wide road free of traffic or other paved surface with a mild to moderate
slope. Make sure you have enough space to set the cones or markers
according to the instructions in the video. Also ensure that cone placement
does not create a hazard for anyone.

**Objective**
Learn to be centered and balances on outside skate throughout the turn.

**If done correctly**

* Skater maintains control through the turn
* Shins and knees are aligned
* The “stomps” are evenly spaced at the top, middle, and bottom of the turn
* The “stomp” inside skate is set down parallel to the outside skate
* Stomp is a light touch with weight and balance maintained on outside skate

**Common challenges**

* Turns aren’t symmetrical
* An even “stomp” tempo is not maintained
* Skater puts too much weight on the stomping (inside) foot
* Skater is not equally proficient with both legs

**Summary**

This exercise is designed to build confidence when balancing solely on the outside
skate. This drill challenges your independence and balance on each foot. You may
find this drill more difficult on one side than the other. This is normal and is often the
case on skis as well. Working on this discrepancy on inline skates will make it much
easier to trust your weak side when back on snow.
If you’re struggling to make three smooth stomps, try reducing to two or even one
stomp. Then build up to three as you gain better balance and confidence with this
movement.

### Phase 3 checklist

**Before progressing to phase 4, make sure you
are solid on the following:**

* Performing all the exercises within the designated course
* Maintaining good upper and lower body separation and control
* Tapering in and out of wide and short radius turns on a slope
* Maintaining control when changing the lane of travel
* Using turn shape to control speed down a slope
* Transferring weight properly in the transition between turns
* Building confidence balanced on outside skate while turning

## Phase 4

In Phase 4 the ski specific cross-training ramps up to a higher level of
challenge. If you can master these drills, you will have developed the
balance, strength, coordination, and explosive power that will pay huge
dividends the next time you hit the slopes!

### Power carve

{% include video id="7vmVFz7h0LE" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Power carve](/assets/images/skate-power-carve.jpg){: .align-right}-->
Begin on a smooth, flat, paved surface with no slope. Progress to slightly
uphill terrain.

**Objective**

To develop leg strength and power by pumping down and out through each parallel
turn to generate momentum rather than by striding. To eventually apply this skill to
climb slight inclines.

**If done correctly**

* Momentum is created and maintained solely through pump turns
* The pump starts from toes and flows to the heel
* Legs are contracted at the top of the turn and extended into the bottom of the turn
* Isolate the explosive movement in the lower body with relatively quiet upper body

**Common challenges**

* Momentum is lost
* Skater doesn’t get deep enough flexion to “load the spring” at the top of the turn
* Excessive upper body motions are used to maintain momentum

**Summary**

This drill is primarily a strength and conditioning exercise. It is designed to build the
muscles necessary to load a ski and generate explosive power.
This skill should be mastered on flat terrain before attempting to use it to push
yourself up an incline. As you master this skill, try out increasing the degree of incline
to see if you can maintain momentum.

### Hop turn warm-up

{% include video id="CpBGPohysh0" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Hop turn warm-up](/assets/images/skate-hop-turn-warm-up.jpg){: .align-right}-->
Begin on a flat to slightly sloped grassy area, progressing to a flat to slightly
sloped paved area.

**Objective**

To develop the balance, coordination, and body movements necessary for performing
hop turn on skates.

**If done correctly**

* Knees and ankles are deeply flexed, hands out front
* Upper body remains squared off facing the fall-line
* Compression and extension is done with the legs - minimal motion with the upper
body during the jump
* Skater is landing as softly as possible

**Common challenges**

* Upper body rotates along with the lower body, landing facing across the hill
* Landing is out of balance and rolling – not across the fall-line
* Overly hard landings – legs not absorbing impact

**Summary**

This drill is designed to create a platform to literally launch you into a rolling version
of this movement. Make sure you are solid with this exercise before progressing to
rolling hop turns.
Performing this drill repeatedly on grass is also a great exercise for developing
strength and power in the legs. This can be done as an interval exercise on its own.

### Hop turns

{% include video id="lQma44nf7hw" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Hop turns](/assets/images/skate-hop-turns.jpg){: .align-right}-->
A road or trail free of traffic or other paved surface with a slight to moderate
slope. Also ensure that cone placement does not create a hazard for anyone.

**Objective**

To perform a turn transition in the air, leaving the ground at the bottom of a turn and
landing at the top of the new turn.

**If done correctly**

* Both feet remain parallel and leave the ground at the same time
* Upper body remains quiet
* Shoulders are level
* Feet land in a position that immediately starts the next turn

**Common challenges**

* Losing balance and control while jumping or landing
* Body is too rigid to absorb the landing
* Hops are too small or too lateral to effectively land in the next turn
* Skater cannot maintain the tempo of the set course

**Summary**

Have fun with this drill and try to be as fluid and dynamic as possible. This drill
combines many of the skills learned in previous videos into one. In order to perform
correctly, you must leave and land on the ground in a strong balanced position, and
parallel stance. You must then use knees and ankles to immediately carve a quick
turn and again be in a strong position to leave the ground again.

Starting out on a flat surface that you skate into with momentum is a good way to get
familiar with the motion before trying on a slope. Eventually, finding the right slope
is a key factor.

This is a challenging and higher impact exercise. Unlike other skills in the series, this
skill does not need to be mastered in order to progress to the next exercises.

### Single leg turns

{% include video id="3X0Us2cJHzs" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Single leg turns](/assets/images/skate-single-leg.jpg){: .align-right}-->
Begin on a smooth, flat, paved surface. A very slight slope may be helpful
to fully develop this skill. Without any pitch it can be harder to create and
maintain momentum throughout single leg turns.

**Objective**

To develop the balance, coordination, and agility necessary for inside and outside edge
control on one foot. This is done while performing short radius turns in a straight line.

**If done correctly**

* Skater maintains deep ankle and knee flexion throughout the turn
* The turning skate pitches laterally from pinky toe edge (outside) to big toe edge
(inside) equally through each turn
* The outside edge turn has the same turn shape as the inside edge turn
* Cones are placed far enough apart to allow adequate space for turns

**Common challenges**

* Momentum is lost during the turns
* Course is set on too steep a decline – too much momentum
* Body is not centered and stacked over the wheels – especially on pinky toe
(outside) edge turns
* Overuse of upper body motions to maintain balance

**Summary**

Similar to one leg ski turns, the challenge of this drill is typically in making the pinky toe
(outside) edge turn. Making the outside edge turn requires you to be flexed, stacked over
your turning foot, and to drive your knee into the direction of the turn. This exercise on
skates builds the skills and body position necessary to carve on your uphill ski.

If you’re having challenges with this drill make sure your skates are securely
tightened. Loose fitting skates are almost impossible to balance on. This is also a drill
that is easier to perform if you are using molded shell vs soft upper skates due to the
support they provide.

### Outside leg turns

{% include video id="TtZwpz_SCN4" provider="youtube" %}

**Terrain**

<!--![Outside leg turns](/assets/images/skate-outside-leg.jpg){: .align-right}-->
A wide road free of traffic or other paved surface with a mild to moderate slope.
Make sure you have enough space to set the cones or markers according to the
instructions in the video. Also ensure that cone placement does not create a
hazard for anyone.

**Objective**

To develop the ability to turn and balance completely on the outside / downhill skate
while performing medium to long radius turns.

**If done correctly**

* Skater maintains deep ankle and knee flexion throughout the turn
* Even turn shape with both left and right turns
* Each turn is complete, finishing across the fall line
* Upper body remains facing down the fall line throughout the turns

**Common challenges**

* Skater cannot keep uphill leg off the ground
* Overuse of upper body motions to maintain balance
* Skater is much stronger on one turn than the other
* Course is set on too steep a decline – too much momentum

**Summary**

This drill is one of the most challenging in the Skate to Ski Training System. It
requires all the balance, strength, and coordination developed in previous exercises.
Be patient with this drill. If you are struggling with this drill, review the Stomp Turns
drill in Phase 3. It can also be helpful when first attempting this skill to keep the
raised skate with the front wheel pointing slightly down.

Once you’ve mastered Outside Leg Turns, challenge yourself with increasing degrees
of slope. You can also perform the Hourglass Turns and Lane Changes drills using
only Outside Leg Turns.

### Phase 4 checklist

**Make sure you are solid on the following:**

*Generating momentum using power carve parallel turns
*Remaining balanced and landing softly with standing hop turns
*Performing rolling hop turns within a designated course
*Maintaining a balanced body position during rolling hop turns
*Turning consistently on one leg in both directions
*Performing six medium to long radius turns on downhill skate
*Maintaining quiet upper body throughout all drills in this Phase

## Rules of the road

* Before using your skates, know and understand the skating and traffic regulations
of your city, state or country. In some places it is forbidden to skate on the public
roads.
* Always wear protective gear (helmet, wrist-guards, elbow and kneepads).
* Learn inline skating basics; such as braking and turning before going out on the
open path or road.
* Stay alert. Always skate under control.
* Do not use headphones that limit your ability to hear your surroundings while
skating.
* Stop skating and inspect your skates immediately if you hear clicking or other
unusual sounds coming from your skates while skating. This could be an
indication of a loose bolt or other damage.
* Always skate with the Allen key provided with your skates in case it is needed to
tighten bolts. Carry in a place on your body that will not cause injury if you fall.
* Avoid debris, rocks, oil, sand, water and uneven or broken pavement.
* Avoid areas with heavy traffic.
* Never grab or hold on to moving motorized vehicles.
* Always be aware of your speed while skating, especially while going down hill.
Skating down hill makes slowing and stopping much more difficult.
