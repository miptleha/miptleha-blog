**August 15th**. Here we and in Canada!!! I am fascinated by this country! Here it is delightful! Mountains so prerasny. With impatience I wait, when I shall see their covered by a snow.

**October 14th**. Canada! This most wonderful place on the ground! Leaves on trees have turned yellow and have got all shades of a spectrum, from red up to orange. Yesterday has made a fascinating trip for city, in a countryside. You will not believe! Saw wild deers! On will, they so are beautiful and graceful. Really it is the most charming animals on a planet. Well simply pretty girls! No, here really paradise!

**November 11th**. The season of hunting for deers soon opens. It is awful! I can not present myself, that at whom that can rise a hand on this lovely, harmless creation. Any day we expect a snow. Here it is pleasant to me!

**December 2th**. At last that! The snow This night has dropped out. HURRAH!!! Having woken up to morning, we have found out a charming picture behind a window. All is covered by a snow-white, fluffy coverlet. A kind, as on a surprising christmas card! I am admired! We with the wife have joyfully run out from the house, and quickly cleared a porch and a parking before the house, we with a laughter began to throw snowballs. (I have won). Suddenly the snowplow has driven by us, having filled up all parking a snow. But it I have not upset us, and throw a snow back. As here it is good! I like Canada!

**December 12th**. The snow this night has again dropped out. The snowplow has repeated the trick and has filled up a parking.

**December 19th**. Again there was a snow at this night. I and could not clear a parking and leave on job. Here it is certainly magnificent, but I have already grown weak, constantly clearing a parking from a snow. An idiotic snowplow!

**December 22th**. Again this at night fell white frost! I have earned bloody blisters on hand and a constant back pain, from infinite cleaning a snow. Such impression, that this woodpecker on a snowplow is hidden behind an angle and only and waits when I clean a snow from a parking. * PA!!!

**December 25th**. Merry Christmas! Again this snow!!! If only to reach that throat * kina the son, which on a snowplow. I swear, would strangle * yes!!! And then, why urban services not scatter salt on ice-covered roads? Yesterday went and it was not killed nearly.

**December 27th**. At night has again dropped out white snow!!! The Third day I sit at home, except for sorties for clearing a parking after a snowplow. I can not get out anywhere. The machine has disappeared under mountain of this white snow! And as it is brutally cold! The dude from a bureau of forecasts promises 20 more centimeters white snow this night. The GOAT!!! And you know, how much shovels of a snow it will make of 20 centimeters???

**December 28th**. This m@*n from a bureau of forecasts was mistaken! 50 centimeters have dropped out. Similar, this... the snow will not melt till the summer. The snowplow has got stuck near our house, and this *dak the driver has come running to us with the request to borrow a shovel. I have told to him, that have broken six shovels, throwing back that white *rmo with which he filled up our parking, and now I shall break the seventh about his mutton head.

**January 4th**. Today at last we were able to get out from the house!!! Has gone to shop to buy food. And here, on a return way this cattle - a deer and brakes hoofs all car front takes off on road. Injury on three thousand dollars!!! Well why hunters not kills these * skud in November? These deers everywhere and everywhere. That them would break off!

**May 3th**. Has brought the car to a workshop. You will not believe, but this cart has had time to rust at all, from salt which goats from urban services strewed on roads.

**May 10th**. All! I leave for Florida. I can not present myself, that somebody, being in sensible mind, will wish to live in this Canada!
